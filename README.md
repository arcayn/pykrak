# PyKrak

PyKrak is a powerful tool for extensible and modular automated cryptanalysis of classical ciphers. There are a number of automated
solving methods already included in the module, and it is easy to build your own. In addition, whilst there is a selection of ciphers
implemented so far, it is designed to be easy as possible to write your own ciphers to cryptanalyse with the tool.
